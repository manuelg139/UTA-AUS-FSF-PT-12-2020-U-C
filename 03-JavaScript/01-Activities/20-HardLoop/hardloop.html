### Instructions

* Starting from scratch, write code that loops through the following array and logs the name of each animal on the farm to the console:

```
var myFarm = ["chickens", "pigs", "cows", "horses", "ostriches"];
```

* Then check if the first letter in the animal's name begins with a "c" or "o". If it does, create an alert saying, "Starts with 'c' or 'o'!"

* **HINT:** You can access the first character of a string as if it were the first element of an array.

    <script type="text/javascript">

var myFarm = ["chickens", "pigs", "cows", "horses", "ostriches"];

for(var i = 0; i < myFarm.length; i++){
    console.log(myFarm[i]); 
 
    if(myFarm[i].charAt(0) === "c" || myFarm[i].charAt(0) === "o"){
        alert("Starts with a 'c' or an 'o'");

    }

}
